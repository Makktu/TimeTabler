# TimeTabler

Just another self-teaching app, with the simple-as-possible philosophy still to the fore.

-   Display a week with sectioned times.
-   User can click/tap-and-drag to fill in/delete time blocks.

That is all for now. Deeper options (adding text, managing real-world dates and multiple weeks etc.) to follow at a later time.
